Call me, baby

## Summary
Call me, baby is an appointment reminder SPA. Users create an appointment with a time, description and text message body. It does the AJAX call to index, patch, post, and delete an appointment.

## Technologies Used
- Handlebars
- jQuery
- AJAX

## Unsolved Problems on the Front End
- Inline Edit and Delete: Having to pass in the data id in order to delete or edit that resource is TERRIBLE UI. I was lucky enough to work with people who solved this problem in project 2 on project 3.

- Styling: The tables in handlebars should at least be bootstrap rows, and some color, some fonts, some layout would be nice!

- Emberify! I'd really like to redo this in ember instead of the GA Browser Template! I had soooo many helpers and still relied on getFormFields for this project. I'd really like to use a front end framework
